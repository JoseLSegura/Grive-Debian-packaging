The new verion of Grive includes a new graphical client called
"bgrive". This program is only a proof of concept and it is still
plenty of bugs. This reason and the fact that it would depend on
libqt4-dev to be compiled has pushed me to include a patch that avoid
the compilation of bgrive.

Notes for libjsonc/libjson-c2 library
-------------------------------------

The library JSON-C in Debian is in transition from its old name
(libjson0) to its new denomination (libjson-c2). I have changed the
control file of the package to avoid depending on a transition package
as libjson0-dev, but it is not enough to being able to compile Grive,
because the include paths of the library has changed too. It was
needed to include a patch to adapt the old-fashion include paths to
the current ones.
